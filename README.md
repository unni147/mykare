# Features

## Voice Conversation

* Voice-first user experience
* Speech-to-Text transcription using Deepgram
* Natural conversation powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash
* Context-aware multi-turn conversations
* Supports 5+ back-and-forth exchanges
* Low-latency voice interactions

## Intelligent Tool Calling

The assistant automatically invokes backend tools based on user intent.

Implemented tools:

* identify_user
* fetch_slots
* book_appointment
* retrieve_appointments
* modify_appointment
* cancel_appointment
* end_conversation

## Appointment Management

Users can:

* Book appointments
* View existing appointments
* Modify appointments
* Cancel appointments
* Prevent double bookings
* Receive appointment confirmations

## Voice Assistant Interface

* Animated healthcare avatar
* Listening state
* Processing state
* Speaking state
* Call-style interaction experience
* Real-time activity tracking

## Conversation Summary

At the end of each session the assistant generates:

* User information
* Appointment actions
* Conversation intent
* Appointment status
* User preferences
* Timestamp

# Cost Monitoring & Call Analytics

The application tracks the estimated cost of each conversation by measuring the AI and voice services used during the interaction.

Metrics include:

- Speech-to-Text Cost (Deepgram)
- LLM Processing Cost (Gemini)
- Text-to-Speech Cost (Cartesia)
- Total Session Cost
- Session Duration
- Tool Call Count

This enables visibility into operational expenses and helps evaluate the scalability of the voice assistant.

# Core Functionalities

## User Identification

The assistant identifies users through their phone number and uses it as a unique identifier for appointment management.

## Slot Retrieval

Available appointment slots are fetched dynamically and presented to the user.

## Appointment Booking

The assistant:

* Validates slot availability
* Prevents double booking
* Saves appointments in SQLite
* Provides confirmation details

## Appointment Retrieval

Users can retrieve previously booked appointments using their phone number.

## Appointment Modification

Users can modify existing appointments by selecting a new date and time.

## Appointment Cancellation

Users can cancel appointments through natural voice commands.

## Conversation Summary

A structured summary is generated when the conversation ends.

### Cost Tracking & Analytics

- Cost-per-call estimation
- Session duration tracking
- Tool usage tracking
- Voice pipeline cost visibility
- Operational monitoring metrics

# Deployment

## Backend Deployment

Deployed on Render.

Production start command:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```

## Frontend Deployment

Deployed on Vercel.

Environment Variable:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=<BACKEND_URL>
```

"This deployment is running on the free tiers of Render and Vercel, so the first request may take a few seconds due to cold starts. Subsequent interactions are significantly faster."

# Design Decisions

### Simplified Voice Architecture

To optimize delivery time and maintain reliability, a streamlined REST-based architecture was chosen instead of a fully streaming WebRTC implementation.

### Server-Side Tool Calling

All tool execution occurs server-side, reducing security risks and preventing client-side manipulation.

### Lightweight Avatar

A CSS-based animated avatar was implemented to provide a responsive user experience without introducing heavy rendering dependencies.

### Modular Voice Stack

The architecture separates:

* Speech Recognition
* Reasoning
* Tool Execution
* Speech Synthesis

allowing individual components to be upgraded independently.

# Future Enhancements

* LiveKit integration for real-time streaming conversations
* WebRTC-based voice calls
* Cartesia streaming audio
* Regional language support
* PostgreSQL persistence
* Appointment reminders
* Analytics dashboard
* Cost-per-call tracking
